_React Native library for creating maps
with [TrackAsia Native for Android & iOS](https://github.com/track-asia/trackasia-gl-native)._

This project originated as a fork of [rnmapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps), a community-maintained
React Native library for building maps with the Mapbox iOS and Android mobile SDKs. The original product
supported both Mapbox and TrackAsia for some time, but as the TrackAsia and Mapbox SDKs have
diverged, it has become necessary to separate the projects into specific wrappers by underlying renderer.
